Each DAO class should have:
1. an add function
2. a select all entries function
3. a select an entry based on id function
4. an update function
5. a delete function

DAOs with name fields should have a way to get an entry by name
Possibly a way to check if an entry is already present in the table
I.E. check if a username is already present before attempting to insert it (isPresent function in the UserDAO)

Maybe other functionality, this is all I can think of at the moment.
